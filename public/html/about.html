                    Hello! My name is Ryan Case, and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I am currently
                    gaining
                    experience and building my portfolio
                    through the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp. My goal is to take the skills
                    that I learn
                    through this program, and translate it into a career in Web Development. In
                    addition, I
                    desire to
                    create dynamic projects both professionally and recreationally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to discovering my passion for web development, I studied at Liberty
                    University.
                    In 2017, I graduated with a Bachelor's
                    of Science in Psychology, but I had already decided I no longer desired to pursue a
                    career in that
                    field. It was at this point that I had to ask myself, "What are my skills, and what
                    do
                    I enjoy?"
                    I came to the conclusion that due to my passion for working with software, solving
                    problems, and
                    creating exciting projects, Web Development was the right career for me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I appreciate your time in reading a little about me and my journey. If interested,
                    feel
                    free to take a look at my portfolio.
                </p>
